## Deep learning cross-platform image retrieval website based on image cognition
Cross-platform picture intelligent aggregation search tool is an image understanding search tool based on tensorflow.js to implement deep learning algorithm on the webpage. It aggregates third-party cloud albums used by individual users such as Baidu Cloud, 51 cloud disk, micro disk, and realizes cross Platform upload and retrieval capabilities. The search function does not rely on artificial text labels, and the information is extracted based on the deep learning model. Three application schemes are designed: scene recognition map, hand-painted search map, and text search map. And through the deep learning model based on context understanding, all the images are processed and the index based on the feature vector is established, which greatly protects the user's privacy and information security. At the same time, because of its novel design model and the application of tensorflow.js, the operation is distributed to the webpage of individual users, avoiding the problems caused by centralized distribution, efficient and reliable.
